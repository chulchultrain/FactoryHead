# FactoryHead
Increase Win Rate in Pokemon Platinum Battle Factory. 

#For Who
This project is for players of the Pokemon Platinum(and HeartGold/SoulSilver) Battle Factory.

#More on what it does
Given what we know about the opposing Pokemon, we can draw ourselves a more complete picture about that Pokemon.
The Battle Factory has a set Pokemon Entry List that the Factory Trainers get their Pokemon from.

That list can be found at http://www.psypokes.com/platinum/frontier_pokemon.php. 

Now, given the little information and few hints that the guy that allows you to trade a Pokemon between matches gives you, 
we can map that information to the Pokemon in that list that are consistent with that information. That is what my project does.

You feed it a little information, and it will retrieve the list of Pokemon consistent with that information.

#Other helpful resources
Now, species and movesets do not give us the full picture. However, I have found a site that calculates damage done
between two entries. That site is http://pokemonshowdown.com/damagecalc/

#Problems
I have recently found out that the PsyPokes Pokemon Entry List is not 100% accurate with respect to EVs(every other aspect
of data is accurate). Also, this list does not include Pokemon abilities(e.g. Synchronize, Sand Veil).

#Potential Fixes
As I play through Battle Factory and use this and the damage calculator site, I will calculate any mistakes in EVs and record
Pokemon abilities in the Entry List in this repo.
