					One problem with my mapper is that not all of the EVs are accurate. The accuracy of my mapper determines
					strategies regarding that entry. For example, I must be wary of an entry with max speed EVs if my pokemon
					is fragile. Also, if my Pokemon has high special defense but low defense, I must be more wary of an entry with high
					attack than one with high special attack.
					So what I shall do is create a program that determines a Pokemon's EVs given its working stats.
					
					
					#TODO: Add the use of this with respect to the mapper.

					One pain point with my mapper is that given what we know many different entries can be returned. 
					However, some pieces of information given a certain query are more likely than others.
					What I will do is create a program that given a query, 
					the most likely information and their probabilities will be returned.
					
					
					<br><br>
					Let us say I am facing a certain Pokemon that I do not know much about. Using the mapper, I am given 
					a selection of entries that this certain Pokemon could be. This certain Pokemon could have different kinds of 
					movesets, and for each of these entries, I may need to employ a different strategy based on the information
					that each entry carries. 
					
					In this case, information refers to any attribute and its value.
					Moves are attributes and their names are the move attributes' values.
					
					Let us say for example, half of all the Ground-type entries
					have the move Earthquake, and a quarter of all Ground-type entries have the move Earth Power. So, 
					the program, given a Ground-type query, would return that it is 50% likely that a Ground-type Pokemon would have 
					the move Earthquake, and that it is 25% likely that a Ground-type Pokemon would have the move Earthpower.
