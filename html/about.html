				Pokemon Platinum Battle Factory is one of my favorite games because of the randomization with which I choose my team.
				First, I do not have to perfectly grind out making a level 100 team.
				Second, I have to make a team that I think will work well against my opponent given a limited number of options. In this 
				sense, it reminds of Arena mode in the Hearthstone card game, which for the same reason stated above is one of my favorite games.
				
				I made this out of desire to get the Gold Print in Battle Factory which is obtained after 49 consecutive wins. I once
				reached 41 wins, but lost due to a lack of knowledge.
